In today's world, information is one of the most valuable assets, but there is a major threat to it by the evolving sophisticated malware (malicious software). The first malware was created for fun, but now its a profit-driven industry [1] and in the last couple of years advanced malware uses complex obfuscation methods viz. control/data flow permutation, compression, heap spray, etc. [2] to evade the detection techniques. Also, there is an exponential increase in the number of malware released every year. To detect these malware, various techniques are proposed in the past. These methods range from the early day signature-based detection to Machine Learning techniques [3]. However, it appears that proposed approaches are not sufficient to detect the unknown sophisticated malware. Thus researchers are continuously searching for better techniques to detect the advanced malware and have started applying machine learning techniques for malware detection. These algorithms can detect obfuscated malware and have potential to handle both complexity and scale problem like data pre-processing, feature extraction/selection, model creation and testing. In this Santos et. al claims to obtain an accuracy of ~96% using opcode frequency as features [4]. Later on, researchers also applied file-size based segmentation on opcode frequency and improved the average accuracy using different Machine Learning models and claimed that Random Forest can provide the accuracy up to ~98% with a False Positive Rate (FPR) of ~1.07% [5]. For the analysis they used the benchmark malware samples from the Malicia project [6].
